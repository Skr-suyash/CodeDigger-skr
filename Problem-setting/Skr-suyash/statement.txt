Name - Evan's Unusual Keyboard

Evan has a magical keyboard with strange functionality. Whenever he types, two special keys perform unexpected actions:-

    1. Pressing the 'p'(lowercase) key removes the most recent lowercase letter from the text he's typing. If no lowercase letters are available, this key does nothing.
    2. Pressing the 'P'(uppercase) key removes the most recent uppercase letter from the text he's typing. If no uppercase letters are available, this key does nothing.
    3. Neither the 'p' nor the 'P' letters are added to the text when these keys are pressed.
    
Your task is to simulate Evanâ€™s typing process and determine the final text he produces after typing a given sequence of characters.
For example -
Consider this sequence bCApPPcDpPA - The typed string will be "" -> "b" -> "bC" -> "bcA" -> "CA" -> "C" -> "" -> "c" -> "cD" -> "D" -> "" -> "A"
Hence final text is A

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Input - 
The first line contain the number of test cases (t).
Each of the following t lines contain a string s consisting of lowercase and uppercase alphabets, the sequence of characters he pressed.

Output - 
Print a string which is the final typed text produced according to the rules.

The logic is same but wording is changed. Problem showcases a nice use of stack data structure
